{"name":"TVML Catalog","tagline":"Port of the original TVML Catalog Sample code re-written using atvjs","body":"# TVML Catalog: Using atvjs framework\r\nThis is a port of the original [TVML Catalog Sample Code](https://developer.apple.com/library/tvos/samplecode/TVMLCatalog/Introduction/Intro.html) re-written using [atvjs](https://github.com/emadalam/atvjs) framework. Refer to the framework documentation for its usage details.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nAssuming that you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine, do the following to get started:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ npm install -g gulp karma-cli         # Install Gulp and Karma globally\r\n$ npm install                           # Install dependencies\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Development\r\nBuilds the application and starts a webserver. By default the webserver starts at port 9001.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ gulp\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, it builds in debug mode.\r\n\r\n* If you need to build in release mode, add `--type production` flag.\r\n* You can define a port with `--port 8080` flag. (If you start the server on a different port, make sure to update the same in the native application)\r\n* If you need to run tests while building/starting the application, add `--tests` flag.\r\n* To run just the test suite, `gulp test` or `karma start`\r\n\r\n### Structure\r\nThe project is split into two parts:\r\n\r\n- native: this directory contains the Xcode project and related files. The AppDelegate.swift file handles the setup of the TVMLKit framework and launching the JavaScript context to manage the application.\r\n- web: this directory contains the JavaScript and TVML template files needed to render the application. The contents of this directory must be hosted on a server accessible from the device.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n[MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n","google":"UA-44640221-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
